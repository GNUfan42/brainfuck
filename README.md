"""
I think one thing that ends up happening a lot, especially maybe you zoomers have this problem the worst, which is learned helplessness. 
There's a feeling like you can't do it, you're unable to do it or only smart people do this or some series of excuses that exist where you're the center of your universe and you only focus on yourself, and yourself isn't able to do it. 

Don't have learned helplessness. Fight it. You're much much more more likely and more capable than you probably realize. Most people are. 
There're some people that maybe aren't capeable, but you're probably not one of them. Statistically speaking, if you know how to program you're probably not that person. You probably are a person that is capable in doing it.
So give it a shot. At least once. Unlearn helplessness.

Well, that quote says it all...
I just want to write some code. I'm a bad programmer, but maybe I can be good one day.

This repository contains a simple brainfuck interpreter. It has bugs that I haven't figured out, though.
